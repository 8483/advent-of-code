# advent-of-code

[Official website](http://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

The whole thing has 30 challenges x 2 parts total and it all took place in December 2015. I managed to finish 6 days and then I stopped because I had a business trip. I never resumed solving the challenges.

Inside the files I included the puzzles along with links to both the description and the input. Below each description, I provide the solution done in Javascript.
